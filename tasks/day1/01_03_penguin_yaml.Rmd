In the last step, we will add some additional `YAML` metadata and document options
to the document.

Also in this task, you can try out the options that you find most interesting. But 
I will give you some basic suggestions of what to try.

Knit often, to see the difference that the options make to the document.

#### Metadata

- Add today's date to the document
- Add a subtitle

#### Document options

Today, we mostly worked with `html_document` output. So add some options for this
document type to the YAML header. Be careful to respect the rules of indentation.

Options that might be interesting to try on your document:

- `df_print`: set it to `"kable"` and see how the style of the table that you printed looks like
- Add a table of contents. Explore the following options (start with those that seem most interesting to you):
  - `toc`
  - `toc_depth`
  - `number_sections`
  - `toc_float`: This option is only working for html output only
- If you show your code, you can try different code highlighting themes using `highlight` option
- Try a different theme, using the `theme` option (html only)
  - Values you can try are "flatly", "journal" or "united"
  - [Here](https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/) you can find a list of other themes to try
- Try `code_folding: "hide"` (html only) to hide code and make it available via a button
