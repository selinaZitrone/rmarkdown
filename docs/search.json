As we progress in the workshop, we will incorporate more options, functionality and formatting into the document.\r\nArtwork by Allison HorstThe data is available from the palmerpenguins package. To get it, you have to open RStudio and:\r\nInstall the package with install.packages(\"palmerpenguins\")\r\nTake a moment to get familiar with the data set and its variables:\r\nLoad the package into your R session with library(palmerpenguins) (just do this in the console)\r\nType penguins in the console and you should see the penguins tibble\r\nIt contains data on bill and flipper size, weight and sex of the 3 penguin species\r\nWe will need the data later, so remember that you can access via the variable penguins.\r\n1.2 Create first rmarkdown document\r\nFor all tasks of today, you might find it helpful, to open the R Markdown cheat sheet for reference.\r\nStart by creating a new .Rmd file:\r\nGo to File -> New File -> R Markdown... and\r\nChose HTML as default output format from the Document section (This should be already selected as default)\r\nIf you want, you can already enter a title and author\r\nSave the file in a convenient location on your machine.\r\nBefore you start working with the document:\r\nKnit the document to see what happens\r\nTry the Knit button on top of your document or the keyboard shortcut Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + K\r\nChose different output formats to knit to by clicking on the little black arrow next to the Knit button\r\n\r\n1.2 Let’s add some text\r\nNow start writing your very own paper about the 3 penguins.\r\nFirst, remove all template text from the document except the YAML header and the first code chunk (we will learn later what that does).\r\nBefore you start writing, have a quick look at the Example text that I show below. It is the one we discussed together just now and includes many different markdown formatting elements and some text about the penguin data set.\r\nYou can find the links that I used in the text in the Links section or by right clicking on the text\r\nNow write a text yourself. You can either reproduce my text and use copy paste to type less, or you can write your own text about penguins (or anything else you want to write about). The important thing in this task is to include many different markdown formatting elements.\r\nDuring the writing process, don’t forget to knit your document often. It’s easier to fix mistakes and error messages if you detect them early.\r\n\r\nExample text\r\nThe penguins of Antarctica\r\nSelina Baldauf\r\n25/03/2022\r\nIntroduction\r\nThere are three main penguin species in Antarctica (Chinstrap, Gentoo, Adelie). You can see them in the following figure:\r\nArtwork by Allison HorstIn this paper we want to answer the following questions\r\nHow does bill depth depend on bill length?\r\nWhich penguin species has the highest body mass?\r\nMethods\r\nThe data\r\nThe data was collected on islands in Antarctica and published by Gorman et al. (2014). You can find the original paper with the title “Ecological sexual dimorphism and environmental variability within a community of Antarctic penguins (genus Pygoscelis)” in PLoS ONE1\r\nThe data is published via the palmerpenguins R package which you can find on this website.\r\nThe data contains (among others) the following measurements:\r\nbill length\r\nbill depth\r\nbody mass\r\nsex\r\nmale\r\nfemale\r\n\r\nThe analysis\r\nWe did some plots, calculated some summary statistics and a linear model of the form \\(y = ax + b + \\epsilon\\)\r\nResults\r\nWill be added later\r\nLinks used\r\nHere are the links that I used in the text for URL links and the figure. You can use them to reproduce my text. But feel also free to link other things if you want.\r\nLink to Allison Horst’s twitter: https://twitter.com/allison_horst\r\nLink to the paper: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090081\r\nLink to the palmerpenguins package: https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/\r\nLink to the penguin image: https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/blob/master/man/figures/lter_penguins.png?raw=true\r\n\r\n\r\n2 Add R code\r\n2.1 Load the palmerpenguins in your document\r\nWe will now include some analysis of the penguins data in the document.\r\nAs with “normal” R code, you need to load the palmerpenguins package in your document in the beginning.\r\nA convenient location to load packages is the setup code chunk.\r\nJust add library(palmerpenguins) as a line in this chunk.\r\nYou can always come back to the setup chunk and add all the packages that you need in your analysis. Then you have all the library() calls in one place.\r\n2.2 Add R code chunks\r\nNow let’s add some R code that produces different types of output in the document.\r\nFirst finish all the tasks and then come back to the extra (the linear model) if you still have time.\r\nTry using both the RStudio interface (Code -> Insert Chunk) and the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl/Cmd + Alt/Option + I) to insert R code chunks.\r\nThe different output types we will try are:\r\nA figure for the penguin data set\r\nA summary table of the data set\r\nA linear model with the data set (Extra)\r\nFor each of the output types, go through the following steps:\r\nSelect the location in your document, where you want the output to be (probably the result section).\r\nInsert a new code chunk at the location\r\nWrite the code that produces the output (you can copy it from my examples below)\r\nRun the code inside the document\r\nClick on the little green arrow button next to the code chunk\r\nCareful: if you get an error message, make sure that you run all chunks that your code depends on before. E.g. you probably have to run the setup chunk to load all the packages first.\r\nKnit the document and see how the output looks like\r\nBelow, you find example code for a figure, a table and a linear model. I suggest, you copy my code to your R chunk. If you still have time, you can change the code or write new code.\r\nDon’t forget\r\nEvery time, you use a function from a new package, you have to load the package into the document environment. Just add another library() line to the setup chunk.\r\nKnit your document often to detect errors early on\r\n\r\nFigure\r\nI use ggplot2 to produce the figures, so don’t forget to load the package in the setup chunk.\r\nChose one of the two figure ideas from below:\r\nCreate a histogram of the body mass for the 3 penguin species\r\n\r\n\r\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = species)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.6) +\r\n   scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"darkorange\", \"purple\", \"cyan4\")) +\r\n  theme_minimal()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate a scatter plot of the relationship between bill length and bill depth\r\n\r\n\r\nggplot(\r\n  data = penguins,\r\n  aes(\r\n    x = bill_length_mm,\r\n    y = bill_depth_mm,\r\n    color = species,\r\n    shape = species\r\n  )\r\n) +\r\n  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.8) +\r\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\r\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"darkorange\", \"purple\", \"cyan4\")) +\r\n  theme_minimal()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary table\r\nI create a summary table of the mean variable values grouped by penguin species and sex.\r\nI use the dplyr package here, so don’t forget to load it in the setup chunk.\r\n\r\n\r\npenguins %>% \r\n  filter(!(is.na(sex))) %>% \r\n  group_by(species, sex) %>% \r\n  summarize(\r\n    bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),\r\n    bill_depth = mean(bill_depth_mm, na.rm = TRUE),\r\n    flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),\r\n    body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLinear Model (Extra)\r\nI create a linear model to test the effect of bill length on bill depth and to see if it differs between species.\r\nDon’t worry if you don’t know exactly what a linear model is. This course is about markdown after all :)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Calculate the linear model\r\nlm_penguins <- lm(bill_depth_mm ~ bill_length_mm + species, data = penguins)\r\n# Create the summary table\r\nsummary(lm_penguins)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.1 Add inline code\r\nAdd some sentences to the document that use R code to report some numbers.\r\nYou can start with the ideas below. If you still have time in the end, you can add more sentences:\r\nReport the mean body mass of all penguins, e.g. like this:\r\nThe mean body mass of all penguins is 4202 g.\r\n\r\nExtra\r\nCan you report the number of penguins and their body mass separately for the three penguin species?\r\nHint: Calculate the mean weight of the penguin species in a separate code chunk and save them in 3 variables. Then you can use these variables in the inline code.\r\n2.3 Chunk options\r\nNow we modify some of the code output using chunk options.\r\nStart with the chunk that produces the figure:\r\nAdd a figure caption.\r\nIf you want, change the figure size using either fig.width and fig.height or out.width\r\nAlign the figure where you like to have it\r\nKnit the document and look at the output.\r\nNow think of some global chunk options that might make sense for your document. Add the ones that you like to have to the knitr options in the setup chunk.\r\nYou can for example think of things like:\r\nShould the R code be shown in the document?\r\nShould warnings and messages be printed into the document as well?\r\n\r\n3 Change YAML header\r\nIn the last step, we will add some additional YAML metadata and document options to the document.\r\nAlso in this task, you can try out the options that you find most interesting. But I will give you some basic suggestions of what to try.\r\nKnit often, to see the difference that the options make to the document.\r\nMetadata\r\nAdd today’s date to the document\r\nAdd a subtitle\r\nDocument options\r\nToday, we mostly worked with html_document output. So add some options for this document type to the YAML header. Be careful to respect the rules of indentation.\r\nOptions that might be interesting to try on your document:\r\ndf_print: set it to \"kable\" and see how the style of the table that you printed looks like\r\nAdd a table of contents. Explore the following options (start with those that seem most interesting to you):\r\ntoc\r\ntoc_depth\r\nnumber_sections\r\ntoc_float: This option is only working for html output only\r\n\r\nIf you show your code, you can try different code highlighting themes using highlight option\r\nTry a different theme, using the theme option (html only)\r\nValues you can try are “flatly”, “journal” or “united”\r\nHere you can find a list of other themes to try\r\n\r\nTry code_folding: \"hide\" (html only) to hide code and make it available via a button\r\n\r\n\r\npaper available here.↩︎\r\n",
