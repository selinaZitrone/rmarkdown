### Create a `rmarkdown` document

Start by creating a new `.Rmd` file:

- Go to `File` -> `New File` -> `R Markdown...` 
- Chose `HTML` as default output format from the `Document` section (This should be already selected as default)
- Enter a title and author for your document (not important what it is - you can change it later)

Create and then save the file (`Ctrl/Cmd + S`) in a convenient location on your machine.

Before we start working with the document just try rendering the template document:

- Knit the document to see what happens
  - Use either the Knit button on top of your document or the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + K`
  - Chose different output formats to knit to by clicking on the little black arrow next to the Knit button
    - If you get an error with one of those, let me know and send me a screenshot of the error message you get.
