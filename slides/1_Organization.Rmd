# Before we get started II

I assume that you already know things like:

- Creating new projects or documents in RStudio

- Basic functionality of RStudio e.g. Console vs. Script, etc.

- Basics of R: concept of variables, functions, packages, ...

- I will use some code examples with functions from the `tidyverse` packages (`ggplot2`, `dplyr`)

We probably all have very different R skills and levels in the group, so 
**please ask if anything needs more explanation**

- There are always some extra tasks for the fast ones that you can but don't have to do
