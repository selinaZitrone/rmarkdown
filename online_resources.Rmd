## General

-   [List of RStudio cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/): You can find a list of all the cheat sheets that RStudio provides there. Below, I listed the individual cheat sheets that are interesting for our course.

-   [RStudio cheatsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/rstudio-ide.pdf): Explains the most important buttons, options, keyboard shortcuts, etc that you have in RStudio.

-   The [Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) provides information on how to style your code according to good practice.

## Twitter accounts to follow

I personally learn a lot of tricks and find a lot of inspiration and resources by following some R people and accounts on twitter. Often people post helpful tutorials or blogpost that you would not find otherwise. If you are a twitter user, you can try that as well. Some suggestions that are in no way complete are:

-   [CÃ©dric Scherer](https://twitter.com/CedScherer) mainly data visualization and ggplot content
-   [Allison Horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst)
-   [RStudio](https://twitter.com/rstudio) official RStudio account
-   [Hadley Wickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham) data visualisation, tidyverse
-   [Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan)
-   [rOpenSci](https://twitter.com/rOpenSci) develop R tools for open science
-   [One R Tip a Day](https://twitter.com/RLangTip) one helpful R tip every day
-   [R posts you might have missed](https://twitter.com/icymi_r) repost R blog posts from different topics
